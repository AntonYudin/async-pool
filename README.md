# async-pool
An asynchronous pool of resources implemented in Rust, Java, C++, and Go.

The goals are:
- compare the amount of boilerplate code
- see how ugly java is (or is it?)
- compare the level of access control that each language provides (immutable/const/private etc)
- attempt to be as idiomatic as possible
